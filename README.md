## This is the repository for the Ludum Dare 40 game Ecstasy of Gold.
In the future, I intend to update it with the suggestions I receive, and fix other bugs that still exist.

## Background
Avoid the guards and get all the coins! But be careful, the guards are equipped with powerful magnets that will attract you as you gather more coins!

## How to play
Control you character with ASWD and move the camera with the mouse. You can stomp in the guards' heads to stop them for a while.
When you get all the coins, the exit will open!

## Comment
Personally, I'm very proud of this game. I've learned a lot making it. My challenges were to learn how to make animations in Blender and make a "complete" game, with Start screens, instructions and at least two stages.
I've completed all of them.
I hope you all play and have a little fun with it!
Cheers!
